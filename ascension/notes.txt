// - Demons will almost always be born in the demonic realm. It requires a large amount of Demonic energy to birth a demon. The
//   universe balanced in a way where the most Demonic energy is in the Demonic realm. Making it extremely difficult for a Demon
//   to be born higher up. It also means demons have an additional realm to climb compared to humans and have to work harder if
//   they continue the demonic path instead of the martial path, due to the amounts of demonic energy.
