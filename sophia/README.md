# Sophia
A set of CMake utility files

## Usage
### Directly
Download this folder and extract it to your project folder. You can then import all the supplied utilities and functions by directly importing the helpers file, which automatically includes all the files in this project, for example:
```cmake
add_subdirectory(sophia)
include(helpers)
```
See my 2D game [**ascension**](https://github.com/r-ggraham/ascension) for how this library is used.
